# AVR-Based Dice Roller
This is the source code for a work in progress "dice rolling" gadget I am making. I am using an ATMega328p MCU, an HD44780 LCD with my home-made drivers (found here)[https://github.com/chr0me-sh/avr-hd44780-lib] and, eventually, a4x4 button board. 

At this time, I am working on the basic stuff such as RNG. Eventually I hope to be able to use the button board to input an amount of dice, specify how many 'sides' the dice have and possibly save results temporarily.
